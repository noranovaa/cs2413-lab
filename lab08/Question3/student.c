/*
Question 3: Is Subsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t,
or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original
string by deleting some characters without changing the order of
the remaining characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Hint:
- This can be solved using two pointers.
